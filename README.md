# RapidProductShoots

Website to create beautiful product shoots fast using AI.

## Inspiration

This is my submission for the Hanko hackathon. I spent quite a lot of time in the ideation phase, wanting to create something of "value" that solved a real-life problem, rather than just a gimmicky product for the sake of the hackathon. While doomscrolling through Reddit, I discovered that product photography is quite a challenge for small businesses on platforms like Etsy. After that, it's been smooth sailing since. I did some market research and talked to potential(?) customers about things they would need from such a website and looked into Hanko, and how exactly it works, whether it's an appropriate auth solution for this project and so on. The Hanko docs are quite well written and have been invaluable throughout the process.

## Tech Stack

-   NextJS
-   Hanko for authentication
-   Prisma as the ORM
-   Supabase for the database
-   Replicate for the model itself
-   OpenAI API for prompt enhancement and such
